/// A standard PC-compatible keyboard might have 102 keys. An appropriate
/// keymap would assign each of them a keycode, by which the user should
/// refer to the key throughout the library.
///
/// Historically, the X11 protocol, and consequentially the XKB protocol,
/// assign only 8 bits for keycodes. This limits the number of different
/// keys that can be used simultaneously in a single keymap to 256
/// (disregarding other limitations). This library does not share this limit;
/// keycodes beyond 255 ('extended keycodes') are not treated specially.
/// Keymaps and applications which are compatible with X11 should not use
/// these keycodes.
///
/// The values of specific keycodes are determined by the keymap and the
/// underlying input system. For example, with an X11-compatible keymap
/// and Linux evdev scan codes (see linux/input.h), a fixed offset is used:
///
/// ```no_run
/// # use xkbcommon::xkb::keysyms::KEY_A;
/// # use xkbcommon::xkb::Keycode;
/// let keycode_A: Keycode = Keycode::new(KEY_A as u32 + 8);

/// labled \<A\> generates the symbol 'a'. If the Shift key is held, it
/// generates the symbol 'A'. If a different layout is used, say Greek,
/// it generates the symbol 'Î±'. And so on.
///
/// Each such symbol is represented by a keysym. Note that keysyms are

    ///
    /// 1. The shortcut's modifiers must match exactly to the state. For example,

    ///    \<Alt\>\<Shift\>\<Tab\>. Further, if only \<Alt\>\<Tab\> is bound to
    ///    an action, pressing \<Alt\>\<Shift\>\<Tab\> should not trigger the
    ///    shortcut.
    ///    Effectively, this means that the modifiers are compared using the
    ///    equality operator (==).
    /// 2. Only relevant modifiers are considered for the matching. For example,
    ///    Caps Lock and Num Lock should not generally affect the matching, e.g.
    ///    when matching \<Alt\>\<Tab\> against the state, it does not matter
    ///    whether Num Lock is active or not. These relevant, or significant,
    ///    modifiers usually include Alt, Control, Shift, Super and similar.
    ///    Effectively, this means that non-significant modifiers are masked out,
    ///    before doing the comparison as described above.
    /// 3. The matching must be independent of the layout/keymap. For example,
    ///    the \<Plus\> (+) symbol is found on the first level on some layouts,
    ///    and requires holding Shift on others. If you simply bind the action
    ///    to the \<Plus\> keysym, it would work for the unshifted kind, but
    ///    not for the others, because the match against Shift would fail. If
    ///    you bind the action to \<Shift\>\<Plus\>, only the shifted kind would
    ///    work. So what is needed is to recognize that Shift is used up in the
    ///    translation of the keysym itself, and therefore should not be included
    ///    in the matching.
    ///    Effectively, this means that consumed modifiers (Shift in this example)
    ///    are masked out as well, before doing the comparison.
